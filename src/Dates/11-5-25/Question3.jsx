// Build a component called SearchResults that:

//     Has an input field where a user can type a search query

//     Has a button to submit the search

//     When the button is clicked, fetch results from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?q={query} (replace {query} with what they typed)

//     Display the matching post titles below

//     Critical: The effect should only run when the user intentionally clicks the button, NOT every time they type in the input field
